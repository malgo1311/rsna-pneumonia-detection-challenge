# rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge

My solution to this kaggle challenge - https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/overview

Decided to intially try two architectures
1. Faster R-CNN (without hard negative miner)
2. SSD (without hard negative miner)

Finally, Faster R-CNN showed better performance on my test set, so have included the config file that was used.

All the training and prediction was done on Google Colab using GPU. Have included the training and the prediction script.
